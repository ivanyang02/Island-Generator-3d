# Island-Generator-3d

My Island Generator code, rewritten in Unity with C#.

It uses perlin noise instead of the diamond square algorithm I previously used for my Java version. Also in 3D!


Controls

WASD keys are used for horizontal movement, spacebar moves the camera up, and left shift moves the camera down. Move the mouse to look around.
