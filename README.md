# Island-Generator-3d

My Island Generator code, rewritten in Unity with C#.

It uses perlin noise instead of the diamond square algorithm I previously used for my Java version. Also in 3D and with movement!

---Controls---<br />
WASD keys are used for horizontal movement.<br />
Spacebar moves the camera up.<br />
Left shift moves the camera down.<br />
Move the cursor to look around.<br />
